I am a **first-year MSCS student** at **Northwestern University**, specializing in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Ubiquitous Computing**. My research focuses on **intelligent interactive systems**â€”how computational models can enhance human experiences through adaptive, context-aware technologies.

My work spans **interaction modeling**, **multimodal data processing**, and **efficient ML-driven interfaces**, aiming to bridge **human-centered design** with **scalable computational methods**. I am particularly interested in how **ubiquitous sensing** and **AI-driven interaction** can improve **everyday computing environments**.

I earned **honors degrees** in **Computer Science** and **Informatics** from **UC Irvine**, where I conducted research on information retrieval, interactive system design, and computational methods for behavioral analysis. I am currently exploring **PhD** opportunities for **Fall 2026** to further my research in intelligent interaction and ubiquitous computing.
